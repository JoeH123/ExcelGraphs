Before creating graphs in Excel, it is essential to ensure that your data is properly organized and formatted. Follow these steps to set up data for graphing:

\hypertarget{data-organization}{%
\subsection{Data Organization}\label{data-organization}}

Ensure that your data is organized in a logical manner. Typically, data is organized into columns and rows. Each row represents a unique data point, and each column represents a variable or category. The first row may contain headers that describe the data in each column.

For example, let's consider a dataset containing sales data for different products over several months. The first column might contain the names of the products, the first row may have the months, and the cells within the table would contain sales figures.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccccc@{}}
\toprule()
Product & January & February & March & \\
\midrule()
\endhead
Product A & 100 & 150 & 200 & \ldots{} \\
Product B & 80 & 90 & 110 & \ldots{} \\
Product C & 50 & 70 & 90 & \ldots{} \\
\ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} & \ldots{} \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{data-formatting}{%
\subsection{Data Formatting}\label{data-formatting}}

Ensure that the data is formatted correctly. Numeric data should be in numerical format, dates should be recognized as dates, and text should be in the appropriate format. Incorrect data formats can lead to inaccurate graphs.

To format data in Excel, follow these steps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
